Day of the arrival (en)
===

During the lightning-presentation, Alex talks about the aim of our project, its aim
and its methodology. List of things to say about:

 + We won't look at a programming language as at medium to write down algos.
 + We will concentrate on technology
 + We will use real-world code for handouts
 + Students will solve industrial problems during practice by 
   implementing key features missing in a piece of code that solves real-world problems
 + We will use toolchain proven to be at least very descent by the industry.

Jonn talks about "The Dark Side" sub-project, which is heavily related to the 
main project with the only difference that it's optional and aimed to tell
about the ideas behind declarative programming and highly concurrent systems
in very simple language and without drastic paradigm shifts. List of things to say about:

 + First steps in the world of declarative computing which is a (finally) growing approach 
   that is essential for building systems of high complexity that run concurrently.
 + Arguably more advanced topic. Will require at least knowledge equal to the knowledge
   students will get after finishing the corresponding day of our project.
 + Covering many programming languages.
 + Live demos/coding sessions
 + Optional assignments
 + Erlang

TODO: Russian translation maybe?
