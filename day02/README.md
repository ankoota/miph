Here we talk about how (most of modern) computers work, covering Von Neumann architecture
and how does it realate to ASM. @avelenko

Practice

 + Git basics @manpages
 + ASM basics @avelenko

Von Neumann's architecture isn't about software.
Lecture plan: 

 + When it fails (Concurrent world)
 + Why it fails (Shared memory, low level of abstractions, low expressiveness)
 + How it can be solved (Welcome to the world of declarative programming)
