and how does it realate to ASM execution flow. @avelenko

Practice

 + Git @manpages
 + ASM @avelenko

![Von Neumann's architecture isn't about software][fortran77wat]

Von Neumann's architecture isn't about software.
Lecture plan: 

 + When it fails (Concurrent world)
 + Why it fails (Shared memory, low level of abstractions, low expressiveness)
 + How it can be solved (Welcome to the world of declarative programming)
